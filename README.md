# hello-world
This hello-world repository is a way to say hello to all the github community. Thanks for all your beautiful job!
Hi, I'll tell some info about myself. I'm a programming enthusiast, but I only have an average knowledge on that matter. I'm also learning game development and 3D modeling, rigging and animation, to close the circle if you like. And in other matters, I'm a musician and I like art in almost every form. I'm also a math enthusiast. Well, that's enough info for today XD.
